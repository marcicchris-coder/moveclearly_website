## A 1936 Crystal River Home with Timeless Character

Homes built in the 1930s are rare in this part of Florida, especially ones that have maintained so many original elements.

This solid block home reflects a style reminiscent of the Frank Lloyd Wright era, with clean lines, intentional layout, and thoughtful architectural detail. It was a modern build for its day and still feels distinctive today.

- Original windows remain intact.
- An original fireplace anchors the main living space.
- A lovely front porch invites slow mornings and evening breezes from Kings Bay.

These are not features you can replicate easily in new construction. They are part of the character and history of the property.
