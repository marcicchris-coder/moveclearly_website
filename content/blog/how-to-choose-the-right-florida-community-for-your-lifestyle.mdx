Choosing a community is often more important than choosing a specific kitchen or paint color.

## Start with your weekly routine

Build your shortlist around commute needs, school priorities, recreation habits, and proximity to essentials. If a neighborhood does not support your weekly life, it will feel expensive even at the right price.

## Compare in layers

1. Lifestyle fit: pace, noise, neighborhood feel
2. Home type fit: lot size, age, HOA, layout patterns
3. Financial fit: taxes, insurance, expected maintenance

## Use local page research first

Use our area pages for [Dunnellon](/communities/dunnellon), [Ocala](/communities/ocala), and [Inverness](/communities/inverness) to narrow your map before booking tours.

## Keep your filter criteria realistic

Too many strict filters can hide good options. Start with top priorities, then expand if inventory feels limited.
