An inspection is not about finding a perfect home. It is about understanding condition, safety, and near-term repair risk.

## What inspectors usually evaluate

- Roof, attic, and visible structure
- Electrical panels and outlets
- HVAC performance and age
- Plumbing function and leaks
- Appliances and major systems

## How to respond to findings

Focus negotiations on meaningful items: safety concerns, large functional issues, and repairs with short life expectancy.

If you are early in your search, start with the right neighborhoods first in [Crystal River](/communities/crystal-river) and [Lecanto](/communities/lecanto).

## Plan for ownership, not just closing

Use inspection results to set a first-year maintenance budget so your move feels predictable.
