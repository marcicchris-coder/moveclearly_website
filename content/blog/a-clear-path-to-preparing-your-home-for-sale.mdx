Preparation drives results. Homes with a clear pre-listing plan usually attract better offers and fewer surprises.

## Pre-listing priorities

1. Remove deferred maintenance that buyers immediately notice
2. Improve lighting, neutralize visual clutter, and simplify rooms
3. Complete pricing strategy with local comps and timing analysis

## What matters most in marketing

- Accurate photos and copy
- Strong launch week response plan
- Fast showing feedback loops
