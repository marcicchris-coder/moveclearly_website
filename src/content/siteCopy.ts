      'Moving in Florida should feel informed, not rushed. Move Clearly is designed as a local education portal for buyers and sellers who want practical guidance before they make major decisions. Instead of relying on generic advice, you can use our community guides and roadmaps to compare options in a structured way. We focus on what people ask most often: What does daily life feel like in each area? What price ranges are generally common? Which tradeoffs matter before writing an offer or listing a home?',
      'Our community content is centered on Citrus County and nearby areas where many households are balancing lifestyle, budget, commute patterns, and long-term plans. Whether you are comparing Crystal River, Inverness, Lecanto, Dunnellon, Homosassa, Hernando, Citrus Springs, or Beverly Hills, the goal stays the same: reduce uncertainty and help you make a confident call. You will see clear notes on housing style, ideal buyer fit, and practical next steps, plus FAQs written for real conversations instead of marketing claims.',
      'For buyers, the roadmap walks from financing prep to inspections, insurance planning, and closing. For sellers, the roadmap covers preparation, pricing logic, showing readiness, and offer strategy without overpromising outcomes. Every section is written in plain language and built for action. If you are ready to compare communities, start with the Explore Communities hub. If you already know your direction, jump into the Buy or Sell roadmap and work through each step at your own pace.'
